hi i'm a girl i do coding sometimes (mainly lua, sometimes gdscript and java)
i like roleplaying and stories and such, i have anxiety and adhd
(if i dm you it means i think you're cool and i want to talk but i will probably fail miserably at it)

if i annoy you or make you uncomfortable please tell me straight away!! i can not pick up on hints for the life of me

i also kiinda possibly like nsfw stuff, let me know if you're fine with it or not

if i stop messaging you please don't take it personally!! sometimes i find it hard to talk to people, don't know what to talk about, etc
